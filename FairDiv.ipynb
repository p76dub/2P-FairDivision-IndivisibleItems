    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project is to benchmark some alogorithm design to allocate items to two agents. This notebook focuses on same-size allocations, meaning that each agent should receive the same number of goods. As an additional constraint, items are not divisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by D. Marc Kilgour and Rudolf Vetschera article named *Comparing direct algoriths for two-player fair division of indivisible items - A computational study* you can found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2997431)"

    "## How to use this notebook\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use algorithms and get properties of returned allocations. Several classes are defined to help you to create your own algorithms and properties :\n",
    "  * Agent, which store preferences of an agent as long as some helper methods like getting the to ranked item, get the Borda score of a provided allocation ... Take a look to see what can be done !\n",
    "  * Good, which is a simple wrapper to represent items. It has some nice printing  and comparison methods\n",
    "  * ...\n",
    "In the `properties` module, you can find a bunch of functions. They are designed to test several allocation properties such as Pareto-Optimality, Max-Min property and more."
